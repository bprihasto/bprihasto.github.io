Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Bima Prihasto, and I am a lecturer at the Department of Informatics, Institut Teknologi Kalimantan, Indoensia. I specialize in three main areas: Speech Processing, Computer Vision, and Machine Learning.

I began my educational journey at the Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) in Indonesia where I completed both my undergraduate and masterâ€™s degrees. Throughout my studies, I actively participated in various academic and non-academic activities, including student organizations and research projects. These experiences have helped me develop valuable social and professional skills that greatly contribute to my current career.

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD degree at National Central University, Taiwan.

Feel free to contact me for any further information or inquiries!
