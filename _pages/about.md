I am Bima Prihasto, a dedicated lecturer and researcher at a higher education institution in East Kalimantan. With a solid foundation in mathematics, I pursued advanced studies and completed my PhD at National Central University in Taiwan. My dissertation focused on "Non-Parallel Voice Conversion and Speech Synthesis using Contrastive Learning and Deep Learning," showcasing my expertise in machine learning and deep learning.

During my PhD studies, I engaged in several projects related to applications in speech processing and computer vision. I have had the opportunity to serve as a reviewer for prestigious publications such as the IEEE Access Journal and the IEEE ICASSP Conference, known for their high h-index. Additionally, I collaborated on research with Academia Sinica in Taiwan, further enriching my academic and professional experience.
